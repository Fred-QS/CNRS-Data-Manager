# Import

> *The **Import** tab for mass import of projects.*

---

In this import part, we will be able to mass import projects by team.

The expected file is a .zip file whose structure is illustrated on the page. A model of the .xls file is also provided to allow you to correctly fill in the fields expected by the extension.
Once you have imported this file using the import button, it will be tested to see if it is in the correct format and if the values entered are of the expected types. Once this verification is complete, you will be able to confirm the import of your projects.

If the format of the file or content does not match, you will have this display:

The extension will then create all the projects in your WordPress and its projects will be linked to at least one existing team on the site.
