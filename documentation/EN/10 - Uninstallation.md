# Uninstallation

> *Everything that uninstalling the extension entails.*

---

Uninstalling the extension is common to all other uninstallations.
In fact, you just need to go to the installed extensions, deactivate the CNRS Data Manager extension, then delete it. Please note, deleting the application of the extension will result in the deletion of the tables necessary for it to function, and will also delete the files that have been generated in the /wp-include/cnrs-data-manager part.
