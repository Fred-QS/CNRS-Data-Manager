# Mission form

> *The **Mission form** tab for creating and tracking the form.*

---

In this part, you will be able to design a mission form using the tools provided, then monitor its submission by agents as well as managers until the request is validated or abandoned.

First, it is necessary to provide at least one administrator address. The administrator addresses receive forms whose submission deadline is too close to the start of the mission.

Once this address has been entered, you have access to the functionalities of this part, as well as to the form link on the public part.

![Link to form](/documentation/attachments/illustration-31.png?raw=true)

There are three tabs for this part.

## Builder

![The builder](/documentation/attachments/illustration-32.png?raw=true)

Thanks to the left modules that you can add to the central list, it becomes easy to build the form. Once added, each element can be moved up or down in the list using the small arrows located at the top and bottom of the block, then edited by clicking on the pencil tab. You can also delete a block using the trash tab.
A dynamic preview without formatting allows you to better understand your construction in the right part.

## List

![The list](/documentation/attachments/illustration-33.png?raw=true)

A summary table of requests in progress, to be checked, validated or abandoned allows you to monitor agent requests. You can filter by email address in the search field, as well as by status in the selection field.

Depending on the status of the request, you will be able to carry out certain actions such as abandonment or validation (case where the start date of the mission represents too short a deadline and must therefore be submitted for approval by the administrator(s) ).

You can also see revision tracking as well as the managers involved in each revision.

A PDF preview of the form is also available.

## Settings

Several sub-parts are available:

### Debug mode

![Debug mode](/documentation/attachments/illustration-34.png?raw=true)

Debugging mode is used to carry out email sending tests. If activated and the email is entered, all email submissions will be received by this address instead of the original recipients.

### Administration

![Administration](/documentation/attachments/illustration-35.png?raw=true)

You can add or remove administrator emails (a minimum email must be entered). These emails receive notifications when a request is submitted in the time between the start of the mission and its creation does not respect the number of working days.

The generic email is the address that receives confirmation of a validated mission request. The toggle below allows you to activate this reception or not.

The **limit in days** fields are the deadlines to respect when submitting a request, whether in France or abroad.

### Managers

![Managers](/documentation/attachments/illustration-36.png?raw=true)

Managers are grouped by conventions. In fact, at least one agreement and its addresses must be provided. If several agreements are entered, the agent must choose one when entering the request. Otherwise the only agreement entered will be assigned automatically.
The backup email will receive revision notifications if the primary address is entered as *Not available*.

## Frontend

In the public part, once on the form page, the agent must identify themselves. If they are logging in for the first time or have forgotten their password, they will need to reset the password and will receive an email with their first or new password to log in.
Only agents recognized in the UMR can connect.

![Connection](/documentation/attachments/illustration-37.png?raw=true)

Once connected, the agent will have to choose the type of mission, either in France or abroad.

![Mission type](/documentation/attachments/illustration-38.png?raw=true)

Then finally, the agent will be able to enter the form. Tooltips are available to accurately fill out the required fields.

![The form](/documentation/attachments/illustration-39.png?raw=true)

Once the form is completed by the agent, a manager will receive an email if the request does not exceed the submission deadline, and will then review the request. If this is correctly completed, the request will be validated, otherwise a round trip of the request will take place between the manager and the agent until the request is validated. The manager will have observation fields at his disposal for the required fields in order to transmit his notes to the agent for updating the request.
