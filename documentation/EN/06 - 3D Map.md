The extension also provides the use of a three-dimensional world map to appear on the front of the web application via a shortcode.

You will therefore be able to manage the map display options using the default latitude and longitude entries (a small button located at me will allow you to enter its coordinates if you do not know them).
You can then choose the view of the map through the five options and then configure it according to the option chosen. The Update button will allow you to apply the settings changes.

You will also find in the marker section the possibility of being able to add a marker on the map by indicating its label and its coordinates.
