In the Dashboard section, we will have access to two large sub-sections.
The first sub-part is the global view of the data received from the ANN SOAP API, i.e. teams, services, platforms, as well as agents. Simply choose a data type in the selection field to be able to have an overview of the different entities.

In the second subsection, we will see the relationships between teams and projects.
Indeed, we will find the list of projects that have been created on WordPress or imported from the import tab of the extension.
We will be able, per project, to assign teams, and per team, we will have a selection field which will propose an order of priority for displaying the projects on the page of the team concerned.
Priority orders range from 1 (the highest priority) to 16, and can also be hidden (which is the default).
