# Installation

> *All the detailed installation as well as starting the extension.*

---

The CNRS Data Manager extension is installed like all other WordPress extensions. All you need to do is upload the extension's zip folder to the WordPress extension installation section. Once the installation is complete, a few additional steps will be necessary to allow the plugin to configure itself.

In order to work correctly, you need to understand how the plugin works.
The first thing to understand is that this extension allows you to use data from the ANN software which is the data provider to be used in WordPress. The data received concerns the teams, services, platforms and agents of a UMR.

To receive its data, the extension must therefore allow WordPress to connect to the ANN SOAP API via a URL which must be entered in the Settings section. Once this URL is verified and validated by the extension, you will have access to all the tabs available in the extension.

This installation will deploy 5 tables in your database in order to allow the plugin to work.

The extension will therefore allow you to link teams, services and platforms to the corresponding WordPress categories. In doing so, all agents may be affiliated with the various aforementioned entities and will allow WordPress to find them on the members' pages or in the members' widgets, depending on the option chosen, in the different pages dedicated to identity auditing.

You can also deploy a range of shortcodes allowing WordPress to filter its results on category pages as well as project pages.
A custom page kit made available as well as all the necessary assets. Simply ask the extension to deploy these templates, or use the shortcodes yourself within your WordPress pages to display the different modules such as filters, pagination, widget, etc.
